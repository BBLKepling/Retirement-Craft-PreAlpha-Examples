NOT a functional modpack, these are just test scripts I wrote for myself, and also sharing for others to reference.

***Retirement Craft***

"Get off my grass block, you whipper snappers!"

Made by old people, for old people, but still apropiate for grandkids.

Inspired by 20th century crpgs such as Ultima, Might and Magic, and Elder Scrolls, with some elements of Dungeons & Dragons and Final Fantasy.

The Mod List is still to be determined, but will be largely focused on using Compatskills to it's maximum potential. Also books.
